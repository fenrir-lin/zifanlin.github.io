    Oh hi there, it's Ning, currently still a carbon-based life form.</br></br> Happy new year and it's the 21st year in the running of the eternal hourglass. So, how have you been?</br></br>
    I am no longer obsessed with elusive stuff (the leopard can't change its spots though). The meaning of life is to take responsibility. I do biomedical informatics now,
    currently working with the CELEHS group at Harvard Medical School. </br></br>
    I have lived in Northampton for 3 years. Starting from next semester I will be moving to Boston. Hopefully I'll see you there.
<!--    I still go to school at Smith though I don't live there.
