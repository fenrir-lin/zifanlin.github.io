            -> Introduction: </br> 
    
            When being asked about why she made this legendary series, Nene said: "Who would ever want to know this??". </br></br>
            Koutenn is the nickname of one of Nene's friends who live in CutterZ and places other than on the Green Street (aka Far End of the Universe). </br>
            This is a series of games Nene made for these friends who she can only meet for several times a semester (You can never imagine how lazy Nene is).</br></br>
            "Kant never traveled in his whole life, but I visited CZ for like five times the last sem." Nene, lying on her bed, added.
